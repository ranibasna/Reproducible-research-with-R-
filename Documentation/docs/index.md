# Welcome to Reproducible Research with R

Git is a widely used system (both in academia and industry) for version controlling files and collaborating on code. It is used to track changes in (text) files, thereby establishing a history of all edits made to each file, together with short messages about each change and information about who made it. Git is mainly run from the command line, but there are several tools that have implemented a graphical user interface to run git commands.

Using version control for tracking your files, and edits to those, is an essential step in making your computational research reproducible. A typical git workflow consists of:

    - making distinct and related edits to one or several files
    - committing those changes (i.e. telling git to add those edits to the history, together with a message about what those changes involve)
    - and pushing the commit to a remote repository (i.e. syncing your local project directory with one in the cloud)
