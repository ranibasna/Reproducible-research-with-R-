# Welcome to Reproducible Research with R

* AIM OF COURSE:
The overarching aim of this course is to provide a comprehensive survey of the field of reproducible research, particularly as it pertains to medical research. The course will provide participants with the practical tools required for implementing reproducibility in their own research work. Several case studies irreproducible and reproducible research will be analyzed in order to appreciate the various aspects of reproducibility. Tutoring is participatory, with hands-on practical sessions that will allow participants to implement the skill-sets learned.

* This is the tutorial for the computational part of the course. We will be learning how to use the following tools: Git and GitHub, Conda, and finally R markdown.

* Preliminary, incomplete, and probably with lots of typos.

* All comments, feedback and corrections are welcome.

* Scenarios that beneﬁt from reproducibility
    1. New raw data becomes available.
    2. You return to the project after a period of time.
    3. Project gets handed to new PhD student/postdoc.
    4. Working collaboratively.
    5. A reviewer wants you to change a model parameter.
    6. When you ﬁnd an error, but not sure where you went wrong.


    * Preriquests for the course
        - Being familiar with command line.
        - mini conda installed.
        - Git installed.
        - familiriaty with R code is not essential but preferable.
        - familiriaty with markdown language is a plus.
